Welcome to the miniDHT project

	My aim was to make a DHT (Distributed Hash Table) written in C++ with not
	too many dependencies. The DHT itself is based on Kademlia protocol. This
	is the implemetation used in many project including BitTorrent.

Shord description of warious part :

	bdb_* used as a STL kind of interface to Berkley DB.
	miniDHT_* actual DHT (only part needed if you want to use it).
	*.cpp various examples.

Dependencies :

	 - boost (ASIO & serialization)
	 - openSSL (SHA256 or even MD5 if you enable it)
	 - Berkley DB (if you want to use it -DWITH_BDB)
